## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development and clear, concise explanations. Ask before making major architectural changes or significant modifications to existing features. I value well-documented code and a logical, modular structure.

## System Architecture
The application is an Android mobile application leveraging Jetpack Compose for the UI and a multi-module Gradle structure.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Material Design 3:** Utilizes the latest Material You design language with dynamic colors.
- **AndroidIDE-Inspired Interface:** Features a home screen with action cards, an IDE workspace with drawer navigation, bottom sheet panels, and a NavigationRail for feature switching (Editor, Project, Git, Assets, Theme, Layout). BottomSheetBar for development panels (Terminal, Build Output, Logcat, Problems, TODO).
- **Theming:** Centralized theme management supporting light/dark schemes and dynamic colors.
- **Branding:** Custom "CLBM" launcher icon with a cyan-to-purple gradient.
- **Navigation:** Type-safe screen navigation using sealed classes and AnimatedContent transitions.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Language & Frameworks:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose.
- **Build System:** Gradle with Kotlin DSL and custom Convention Plugins, using Koin DI.
- **SDKs:** Compile SDK 36, Target SDK 35, Minimum SDK 24.
- **Architecture:** MVVM with ViewModel and StateFlow, emphasizing a multi-module design.
- **State Management:** MainViewModel manages core application state (navigation, project management). SoraEditorViewModel manages editor state (open files, tabs, content editing).
- **Data Persistence:** Proto DataStore for user preferences and EncryptedSharedPreferences for secure data.
- **Project Management:** Provides 5 distinct project templates, a creation wizard, project list management, Git repository cloning, and import existing Android projects (with copy-to-workspace or link-in-place options).
- **Code Editor:** Advanced Sora Editor integration with TextMate and TreeSitter syntax highlighting, supporting various languages. Features tabbed editing, undo/redo, find/replace, and multiple color themes. Configurable editor settings for font, tabs, line numbers, word wrap, etc.
- **File System Interaction:** Hierarchical file structure display (Android, Project, Packages views) with file operations (create, rename, delete, copy, move), comprehensive browsing, and project selection.
- **Asset Studio:** Comprehensive Vector Asset Studio with icon repository system, SVG to AVD conversion, AVD editor, and export options.
- **Theming:** Full Material Theme Builder with interactive color picker, tonal palettes, font selection, platform selector, dynamic color toggle, schema style selector, and export options.
- **Onboarding:** Multi-page flow for initial setup, including permission handling with live checking and self-healing.
- **Scoped Storage:** Implemented Android 10+ scoped storage using DocumentFile and Storage Access Framework.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Modular Architecture:** Organized into `core/` and `feature/` directories with grouped submodules for actions, plugins, templates, tooling, terminal, datastore, UI, resources, and logging.
- **Main Module (`feature/main`):** Central module containing MainViewModel for all project-related operations (create, delete, open, close, clone, import) and navigation management. Contains HomeScreen, CreateProjectScreen, ImportProjectScreen, OpenProjectScreen, and IDEWorkspaceScreen UI components. **Project Persistence:** MainViewModel scans CLBMProjects directory on startup and syncs discovered projects with DataStore, ensuring projects persist across app reinstalls. All navigation uses MainDestination sealed class exclusively.
- **Git Module (`feature/git`):** Comprehensive Git version control integration with AndroidIDE-inspired UI, including GitOperations interface, data models, repository layer, ViewModel, and dedicated UI screens for changes, history, branches, remotes, and settings. Supports repository cloning with recursive submodules, stashing, and tagging. **Full JGit Integration (org.eclipse.jgit:7.5.0):** All Git operations (clone, status, commit, push, pull, fetch, branch, merge, rebase, stash, tag, diff, cherry-pick, revert, reset) are implemented using pure JGit library - no git binary required. JGitLibrary class in `library/` package provides complete Git functionality on any Android device without requiring git binary installation. GitCloneScreen auto-populates target directory as CLBMProjects/RepoName based on repository URL. Supports credential management for authenticated operations.
- **Theme Builder Module (`feature/themebuilder`):** Full Material Theme Builder with MaterialKolor-style UI, seed color-based theme generation, HCT color space, 7 scheme styles (Tonal Spot, Vibrant, Expressive, Fidelity, Monochrome, Neutral, Content), tonal palette visualization (13 tones), light/dark scheme generation, and export to Android project folders (colors.xml, themes.xml, Color.kt, Theme.kt).
- **Sub-Module Maker (`feature/submodulemaker`):** Dedicated module for creating new Gradle sub-modules (Kotlin/Java) with automatic settings.gradle.kts updates. Features Gradle notation input (e.g., `:core:common`, `:feature:auth`), real-time validation, auto-suggestions, package name generation, Compose support toggle, and preview of generated structure. **Build Variants Feature (Feb 2026):** Reworked BuildVariantsScreen and BuildVariantsViewModel with GradleParser - a robust character-based scanner that parses settings.gradle(.kts) to discover all modules/submodules. Supports multi-line include() statements, Groovy `include ':a', ':b'` syntax, and properly skips comments. Scans each module's build.gradle to detect module type (Application, Library, Java/Kotlin Library) and extract buildTypes/productFlavors from the android{} block using string-aware brace matching. UI displays project info header with module counts, collapsible module groups (App, Core, Feature), module type icons with color coding, and build type selection with color-coded chips (debug=green, release=pink).
- **Asset Studio (`feature/assetstudio`):** Comprehensive Vector Asset Studio with icon repository system, SVG to AVD conversion, AVD editor, and export options. Includes AssetExporter for real Android project export with vector drawables, launcher icons (all mipmap densities), adaptive icons (foreground/background layers), notification icons, and action bar icons.
